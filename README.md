# Pictorial

Pictorial is a web application designed to provide foreign langauge learners with a dictionary 
translated to pictures. 

The list of words is predetermined (for now), and users can choose to upload pictures that best represent the meaning of the word. Users can then choose to upvote pictures that they believe best represent the meaning of the word, and the image with the greatest number of votes will be displayed alongside the word in the dictionary.
